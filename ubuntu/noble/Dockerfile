# Drop a user and a group named 'ubuntu'.
#
# packpack has a userwrapper.sh script that creates a user in the
# container whose UID and GID are the same as ones of a user of
# the host machine that calls packpack. All the actions inside the
# container are performed using this user, so files that are
# created in a volume can be read by the user of the host machine.
#
# A typical host machine user has UID = 1000. It means that the
# userwrapper.sh script attempts to create a user in a container
# and fails, because a user with this UID exists.
#
# Since the UID = 1000 and GID = 1000 are so typical, let's drop
# the container's user with UID = 1000 and GID = 1000 to let the
# userwrapper.sh script succeed on this image.
